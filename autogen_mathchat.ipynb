The logic behind this is that for a quadratic function $ax^2 + bx + c$, when $a>0$, the function is greater than 0 between the roots and less than 0 outside of the roots.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the cases when the root is a repeated root or there are no real roots, if the root is a repeated root, the function is less than zero when x is not equal to the root. If there are no real roots, we need to check the sign of the 'a' value. If 'a' is positive, then the function is always greater than 0. If 'a' is negative, then the function is always less than 0.\n",
